Automated code analysis : Static and/ or Dynamic code analysis

Secure Design:
 - SQL injection attacks
   - Design pattern for security

Architectural design for security
  - Single access point
    - Drawback: could of Single point of failure

Requirement level threats
 - Requirement Engineer do not know what questions to ask for Security
   - Software security expert with Requirement engineer
   - Comprehensive checklist for security
   
Threat modeling
  - STRIDE threat model

Architectural analysis of security

- ToAA
	Tactic-oriented architectural analysis
		Questions the tactics for security
		- Detect intrusion (Logging, SQL injection detection)
		- detect service denial
		- Verify message integrity (sanitizing user inputs)
		- Detect Message Delay
		- Identify Actors
		- Authenticate Actors
		- Authorize Actors
		- Limit actors (database views, role-based access control and business logic to limit the view)
		- Limit Exposure
		- Encrypt Data (At REST)
		- Separate entities
		
- PoAA
	Pattern-oriented architectural analysis
		Checks the security design patterns
		- Follow up on the design decision made on ToAA phase
		- Verify if Security Design pattern is followed
- VoAA
	Vulnerability-oriented architectural analysis
		Source code inspection phase
	- Locate Source code implementing PoAA
	- Various part of system use the security pattern
